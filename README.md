## America's Top News

A fully responsive website built with create-react-app and powered by newsapi.org to display the 20 latest American news headlines. Clicking on a news headline brings up a modal that shows an avatar with a larger picture, a title, a description and a link to the full article. The modal window was built from scratch, no packages. The modal puts an overlay over the rest of the page when it's active. Clicking the modal "close button" closes the modal and returns page to the original view. Clicking outside the modal has the same effect as clicking the "close button".

Technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
